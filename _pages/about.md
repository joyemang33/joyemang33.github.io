*I am currently seeking Ph.D. positions for 2025 Fall, aiming to combing interesting algorithms with practical applications. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me!*

I am Qiuyang Mang (忙秋阳 in Chinese), a final-year undergraduate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), under the guidance of Prof. [Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/). I am currently interning at [Trustworthy Engineering of Software Technologies (TEST) Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/) in the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. [Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/). My focus broadly lies in the intersection of Software Engineering [[ESEC/FSE23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07937), [ICSE24](https://joyemang33.github.io/assets/pdf/GRev.pdf)] and Data-centric Systems [[KDD24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05006), [SIGMOD25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3698810)]. Specifically, I am recently focusing on design efficient algorihms for robustifying graph data management systems and mining graph data. 

In addition to my research, I am actively involved in Competitive Programming. I participated in the 46th ICPC World Finals in Luxor, Egypt (2024). Prior to this, I earned first runner-up and second runner-up positions at ICPC Regionals, representing CUHK-Shenzhen. As a member of [SUA](https://sua.ac/), I have also served as a jury member and problem setter for several ICPC contests.
