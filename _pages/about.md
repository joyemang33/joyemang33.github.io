I am Qiuyang Mang (*ÂøôÁßãÈò≥ in Chinese and is pronounced like "Chew-yahng Mahng"*), a final-year undergraduate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (*CUHK-Shenzhen*), advised by [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/). I was interned at the National University of Singapore, advised by [Prof. Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/), where I and spent an unforgettable year. Overall, my research focus broadly lies in the intersection of Software Engineering [[ESEC/FSE'23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07937), [ICSE'24](https://joyemang33.github.io/assets/pdf/GRev.pdf)] and Data-centric Systems [[KDD'24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05006), [SIGMOD'25-A](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3698810), SIGMOD'25-B, [VLDB'25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00344)]. 

In addition to my research, I am actively involved in Competitive Programming, especially for [ICPC](https://icpc.global/). I participated in *the 46th ICPC World Finals in Luxor, Egypt*. Prior to this, I earned several top 3 places üèÜ at ICPC regional contests. I have also served as a jury member and problem setter for several ICPC contests. 

Apart from my studies, I really enjoy cooking, especially dishes from my hometown (*Shanghainese cuisine*). It‚Äôs a great way for me to relax and connect with my culture. I also have a sweet Ragdoll cat named *Peppa*.
