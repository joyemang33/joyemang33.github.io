Hi, I'm Qiuyang Mang, an incoming Computer Science PhD student at *UC Berkeley* (Fall 2025), where I'll be joining [Prof. Alvin Cheung](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~akcheung/)'s group. Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies at *The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen,* under the guidance of [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/), and spent an unforgettable year as a research assistant at *National University of Singapore* with [Prof. Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/).


My research interests lie in *Data Management*, *Software Engineering*, and *Algorithms*, with a focus on:

- **Database Testing and Verification**: I aim to develop the next generation of *automated database validation techniques*, combining *LLMs* with *post-verification*, toward generating effective, fully automated test cases for database systems.
- **Large Language Model for Database**: I'm exploring how to *train LLMs/LRMs using database execution feedback*, enabling them to understand the internal behavior of database engines and ultimately support *complex query optimizations* and *rule discovery*.
- **From Competitive Programming to Research**: I'm always interested in how techniques from *competitive programming* can translate into solving practical problems, especially in data-centric systems. I'm also interested in *integrating competitive programming expertise into LLMs/LRMs*. 

I understand how deeply research success depends on access and opportunity, and I feel incredibly fortunate for the support and opportunities provided by Pinjia, Manuel, Alvin, and many others along the way. Many talented students—and remarkable people in general—never receive the opportunities they need to fully realize their potential. If you're from an underrepresented group and think it might help to talk or want to collaborate with me, feel free to reach out by [email](mailto:qmang@berkeley.edu).

### Miscellaneous

- 忙秋阳 is my name in Chinese, which is pronounced like "Chew-yahng Mahng".
- I participated in the 46th ICPC World Finals and served as a problem setter for several ICPC regionals.
- Besides my research, I enjoy basketball, cooking, and video games. I also have a beautiful ragdoll cat.
