*I am currently seeking Ph.D. positions for 2025 Fall, aiming to combing interesting algorithms with practical applications. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me!*

I am Qiuyang Mang (忙秋阳 in Chinese), a final-year undergraduate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), under the guidance of Prof. [Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/). I am currently interning at [Trustworthy Engineering of Software Technologies (TEST) Lab](https://nus-test.github.io/) in the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. [Manuel Rigger](https://www.manuelrigger.at/). My focus broadly lies in AI Robustness [[ESEC/FSE23](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07937)] (*e.g.,* developing automated tools for testing and improving AI software ),  testing traditional systems [[ICSE24](https://joyemang33.github.io/assets/pdf/GRev.pdf)] (*e.g.,* databases and compilers), and graph algorithms [[KDD24](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05006)] (*e.g.,* GNN and graph mining). More recently, I have been focusing on testing graph database management systems (*e.g.,* Neo4j) and graph algorithm libraries (*e.g.,* NetworkX). Our work has successfully detected more than 80 bugs in these systems. 

In addition to my research, I am actively involved in Competitive Programming. I participated in the 46th ICPC World Finals in Luxor, Egypt (2024). Prior to this, I earned first runner-up and second runner-up positions at ICPC Regionals, representing CUHK-Shenzhen. I have also served as a jury member and problem setter for several official ICPC contests (currently as a member of [SUA](https://sua.ac/)). Additionally, I participate in Olympiad Informatics education, including NOI and USACO. As part of my part-time job, I am a senior coach at [Xinyoudui](https://www.xinyoudui.com/) (信友队 in Chinese) and [X-camp](https://x-camp.academy/) for course designing and teacher management. If you are interested in collaborating on Competitive Programming, please feel free to contact me.
